This extension bundles together [several Lua filters](/docs/05-about.qmd) üåô that will work with any Pandoc version above `2.17`.

This extension allows for:

- The creation of multiple bibliographies (or bibliographies with multiple sections, such as *primary* and *secondary sources*).
- The citation of arbitrary fields^[In the official nomenclature, CSL has *variables*, BibTeX has *fields*, and RIS has *tags*. As a general rule, we have stuck to the term *fields*.] of the references, such as *author*, *editor*, and *translator* names, or *title* and *original-title* of works.
- The creation of linked indexes of citations.

## New to Quarto <img src="https://quarto.org/favicon.png" style="object-fit: cover;width:1em;height:1em;" />?
Visit the [getting started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) guide to download and install Quarto. Once installed, you can use it to create, build, and preview your documents. Quarto is built on top of Pandoc, and it is compatible with all of Pandoc's features.

I **highly recommend** visiting the [Tutorial: Hello, Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html) to learn how to create your first document with Quarto. You'll learn how to create a document, build it, and preview it; and will learn more about the excellent extensions for [VS Code](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/#quarto-for-vs-code) and [RStudio](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/#quarto-for-rstudio) that will make your life easier.

**Jumpstart:**

- On macOS ({{< fa brands apple >}}), use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to `brew install quarto`.
- On Windows ({{< fa brands windows >}}), use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to `choco install quarto`.
- On Linux ({{< fa brands linux >}}), use your package manager to install `quarto`.

At the core of Quarto lies Pandoc, the universal document converter developed by John MacFarlane, professor of philosophy. You can learn more about Pandoc [here](https://pandoc.org/). In particular, see the [Pandoc User's Guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) [{{< fa regular file-pdf >}}](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.pdf). You can install Pandoc indenpendently, but if you install Quarto, Pandoc will be installed automatically.

Make sure to check [Pandoc-Discuss](https://groups.google.com/g/pandoc-discuss) in case you have unsolved questions. You can also ask questions on [Pandoc at Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandoc).

## Justification ü§î

BibLaTeX users trying out Citeproc would probably be exceptionally pleased with its speed and reliability, and the fact that one can convert bibliography consistently into all formats supported by Pandoc (including HTML, LaTeX, Word, and dozens of others).

Some limitations, however, would inevitably become apparent. First, there is the inability to split the bibliography into multiple sections. Then, there is the lack of commands familiar to BibTeX users, such as `\citetitle`, `\citeauthor`, `\citefield`. Finally, there is the lack of the interesting `backref ` option afforded by bibtex and hyperref, which allows for the creation of linked indexes of citations.

This extension aims to provide a solution to these limitations and, *hopefully*, allow Pandoc and Quarto users to *completely* replace BibTeX/BibLaTeX with Citeproc.

## Installation üì¶
Install using:
```bash
quarto install extension bcdavasconcelos/citetools
```

Activate it by adding `citetools` to the `_quarto.yml` file in the filters section.

```yaml
filters:
  - citetools
```

  If you need a sample project to test it out, you can download the [citetools repository](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/citetools/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) {{< fa brands github >}}

## Quickstart üöÄ

Add the path to the bibliography files to the document YAML header or to `_quarto.yml` üìÅ

```yaml
---
bibliography_bib-name: path/to/bibfile.bib
bibliography_other-bib-name: path/to/otherbibfile.bib
---
```

Place the corresponding placeholders where they should be printed in the document body üñ®Ô∏è

 ```markdown
 ::: {#refs_bib-name}
 :::

 ::: {#refs_other-bib-name}
 :::
 ```

 Cite references [as you normally do in Pandoc](/docs/01-basics.qmd) and they will be linked üîó and backlinked üîó to the bibliography üìö

 ```markdown
 [@citekey]
 ```

 Use `[@Citekey]{.csl_field}` to arbitrarily print specific fields instead of the usual Author-Date üí™

  ```markdown
  [@citekey]{.author}
  [@citekey]{.title}
  [@citekey]{.original-title}
  ```
 Append the field name with a dot (`.`) to avoid creating a link to the bibliography in this particular citationüìç

  ```markdown
  [@citekey]{.author.}
  ```
 This can also be done globally by setting `link-fields: false` in the metadata^[If `link-citations` is `false` then `link-fields` will also default to `false`.] üåê

  ```yaml
  ---
  link-fields: false
  ---
  ```

 You're ready to rock. ü§ò

## Documentation üìö
This [Quarto-powered website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) documents the following filters:

- [{{< fa solid file-code >}}](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/citetools/blob/main/_extensions/citetools/multiple-bibliographies.lua) [multiple-bibliographies](/docs/02-multibib.qmd)
- [{{< fa solid file-code >}}](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/citetools/blob/main/_extensions/citetools/cite-field.lua) [cite-field](/docs/03-cite-field.qmd)
- [{{< fa solid file-code >}}](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/citetools/blob/main/_extensions/citetools/citation-backlinks.lua) [citation-backlinks](/docs/04-citation-backlinks.qmd)

In the future, we plan to add documentation for the following filters:

- [section-bibliographies](https://github.com/pandoc-ext/section-bibliographies)
- [recursive citeproc](https://github.com/dialoa/recursive-citeproc)
