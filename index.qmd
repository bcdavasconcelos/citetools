Cite Tools is an extension of the Quarto Open-Source Scientific and Technical Publishing System, built upon Pandoc and compatible with any version above `2.17`, that bundles together [several Lua filters](/docs_qmd/05-about.qmd) üåô to introduce advanced bibliography features.

## Why a bibliography extension?

Users of the jurassic [BibTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) would probably be exceptionally pleased with the speed and reliability of Pandoc Citeproc, and the fact that it converts documents to over 60 different formats (including HTML, LaTeX, Word).

Out-of-the-box, however, Citeproc does not provide common BibTeX functionalities, such as the ability to split the bibliography into multiple sections, or the ability to cite arbitrary fields of the references (*e.g.* `citetitle`, `citeauthor`, `citefield`). It also lacks the interesting **backref** option afforded by BibTeX and [HyperRef](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/hyperref), which allows for the creation of linked indexes of citations.

Luckely, Citeproc is extensible, and this extension aims to provide a solution to these limitations and, *hopefully*, allow Pandoc and Quarto users to **completely** replace BibTeX/BibLaTeX with Citeproc. It will allow the user to *easily* create multiple bibliographies (or bibliographies with multiple sections, such as *primary* and *secondary sources*), cite arbitrary fields of the references^[In the official nomenclature, CSL has *variables*, BibTeX has *fields*, and RIS has *tags*. As a general rule, we have stuck to the term *fields*.], and create linked indexes of citations^[Linked glossaries can also easily be created by dressing it as bibiography]. All of this with very little configuration needed.

Also, with the advent of Quarto, it has become easier for those not well-versed Lua or Pandoc to use extensions such as this one! So, why not?!

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. Visit the [getting started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) guide to download and install. Once installed, you can use it to create, build, and preview your documents.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
**I highly recommend visiting the [Tutorial: Hello, Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html).** You'll learn how to create a document, build it, and preview it. You will also be taken to the excellent extensions for [VS Code](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/#quarto-for-vs-code) and [RStudio](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/#quarto-for-rstudio) that will make your life easier.

## New to Pandoc <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110831952?s=200&v=4" style="object-fit: cover;width:1em;height:1em;" />?
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a universal document converter developed by John MacFarlane, professor of philosophy, that is at the core of Quarto. To learn more about it, see the [Pandoc User's Guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) [{{< fa regular file-pdf >}}](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.pdf). You can install Pandoc as a standalone application, but it will also inevitably be included in any Quarto instalation.

Make sure to check [Pandoc-Discuss](https://groups.google.com/g/pandoc-discuss) in case you have unsolved questions. You can also ask questions on [Pandoc at Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandoc).

## Installation üì¶

If the prospect of typing something on the command line seems daunting, or if you simply need a sample, you can download the [citetools repository](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/citetools/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) {{< fa brands github >}}  directly and open it in VSCode to see a working example.

Otherwise, create a new project and install it using:

```bash
quarto install extension bcdavasconcelos/citetools
```

Activate it by adding `citetools` to the `_quarto.yml` file in the filters section.

```yaml
filters:
  - citetools
```

## Quickstart üöÄ

Add the path to the bibliography files to the document YAML header or `_quarto.yml` üìÅ

```yaml
---
bibliography_bib-name: path/to/bibfile.bib
bibliography_other-bib-name: path/to/otherbibfile.bib
---
```

Place the corresponding placeholders where they should be printed in the document body üñ®Ô∏è

 ```markdown
 ::: {#refs_bib-name}
 :::

 ::: {#refs_other-bib-name}
 :::
 ```

 You're ready to rock. ü§ò

## Usage üìñ

 Cite references [as you normally do in Pandoc](/docs_qmd/01-basics.qmd#how-to-cite-in-pandoc) and they will be linked üîó and backlinked üîó to the bibliography üìö

 ```markdown
 [@citekey]
 ```

 Use `[@Citekey]{.csl_field}` to arbitrarily print specific fields instead of the usual Author-Date format. This is useful for printing the title of a book or the name of a journal in the text. üéØ

  ```markdown
  [@citekey]{.author}
  [@citekey]{.title}
  [@citekey]{.original-title}
  ```
 Append the field name with a dot to avoid creating a link to the bibliography in this particular citationüìç

  ```markdown
  [@citekey]{.author.}
  ```
 This can also be done globally üåê by setting `link-fields: false` in the metadata^[If `link-citations` is `false` then `link-fields` will also default to `false`.]. This is useful if you want to print the title of a book or the name of a journal in the text, but don't want to create a link to the bibliography.

  ```yaml
  ---
  link-fields: false
  ---
  ```

## Documentation üìö

This [Quarto-powered website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) provides documentation for the following filters:

- [{{< fa solid file-code >}}](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/citetools/blob/main/_extensions/citetools/multiple-bibliographies.lua) [multiple-bibliographies](/docs_qmd/02-multibib.qmd)
- [{{< fa solid file-code >}}](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/citetools/blob/main/_extensions/citetools/cite-field.lua) [cite-field](/docs_qmd/03-cite-field.qmd)
- [{{< fa solid file-code >}}](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/citetools/blob/main/_extensions/citetools/citation-backlinks.lua) [citation-backlinks](/docs_qmd/04-citation-backlinks.qmd)

In the future, we plan to add documentation for the following filters:

- [section-bibliographies](https://github.com/pandoc-ext/section-bibliographies)
- [recursive citeproc](https://github.com/dialoa/recursive-citeproc)
