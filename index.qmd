Cite Tools is an extension of the Quarto Publishing System that is built upon Pandoc, and that introduces advanced bibliography features (that will work with any Pandoc version above `2.17`). It does this by bundling together [several Lua filters](/docs/05-about.qmd) üåô that allow for:

- The creation of multiple bibliographies (or bibliographies with multiple sections, such as *primary* and *secondary sources*).
- The citation of arbitrary fields^[In the official nomenclature, CSL has *variables*, BibTeX has *fields*, and RIS has *tags*. As a general rule, we have stuck to the term *fields*.] of the references, such as *author*, *editor*, and *translator* names, or *title* and *original-title* of works.
- The creation of linked indexes of citations.

## Why make a Quarto Extension? ü§î

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Lack of common LaTeX bibliography features

BibLaTeX users trying out Citeproc would probably be exceptionally pleased with its speed and reliability, and the fact that one can convert bibliography consistently into all formats supported by Pandoc (including HTML, LaTeX, Word, and dozens of others).

Some limitations, however, would inevitably become apparent. First, there is the inability to split the bibliography into multiple sections. Then, there is the lack of commands familiar to BibTeX users, such as `\citetitle`, `\citeauthor`, `\citefield`. Finally, it is missing the interesting `backref ` option afforded by BibTeX and HyperRef, which allows for the creation of linked indexes of citations.

This extension aims to provide a solution to these limitations and, *hopefully*, allow Pandoc and Quarto users to **completely** replace BibTeX/BibLaTeX with Citeproc.

### Ease of use
The advent of Quarto means that even people not well-versed in Pandoc or Lua can use this extension with incredible ease. If opening the command line and installing the extension is too much, is it possible to download the repository [{{< fa brands github >}}](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/citetools/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and simply open it using VSCode.

## New to Quarto <img src="https://quarto.org/favicon.png" style="object-fit: cover;width:1em;height:1em;" />?
Visit the [getting started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) guide to download and install Quarto. Once installed, you can use it to create, build, and preview your documents. Quarto is built on top of Pandoc, and it is compatible with all of Pandoc's features.

I **highly recommend** visiting the [Tutorial: Hello, Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html) to learn how to create your first document with Quarto. You'll learn how to create a document, build it, and preview it; and will learn more about the excellent extensions for [VS Code](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/#quarto-for-vs-code) and [RStudio](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/#quarto-for-rstudio) that will make your life easier.

**Jumpstart:**

- On macOS ({{< fa brands apple >}}), use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to `brew install quarto`.
- On Windows ({{< fa brands windows >}}), use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to `choco install quarto`.
- On Linux ({{< fa brands linux >}}), use your package manager to install `quarto`.

At the core of Quarto lies Pandoc, the universal document converter developed by John MacFarlane, professor of philosophy. You can learn more about Pandoc [here](https://pandoc.org/). In particular, see the [Pandoc User's Guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) [{{< fa regular file-pdf >}}](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.pdf). You can install Pandoc independently, but if you install Quarto, Pandoc will be installed automatically.

Make sure to check [Pandoc-Discuss](https://groups.google.com/g/pandoc-discuss) in case you have unsolved questions. You can also ask questions on [Pandoc at Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandoc).

## Installation üì¶
Install using:
```bash
quarto install extension bcdavasconcelos/citetools
```

Activate it by adding `citetools` to the `_quarto.yml` file in the filters section.

```yaml
filters:
  - citetools
```

  If you need a sample project to test it out, you can download the [citetools repository](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/citetools/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) {{< fa brands github >}}

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Quickstart üöÄ

Add the path to the bibliography files to the document YAML header or to `_quarto.yml` üìÅ

```yaml
---
bibliography_bib-name: path/to/bibfile.bib
bibliography_other-bib-name: path/to/otherbibfile.bib
---
```

Place the corresponding placeholders where they should be printed in the document body üñ®Ô∏è

 ```markdown
 ::: {#refs_bib-name}
 :::

 ::: {#refs_other-bib-name}
 :::
 ```

 Cite references [as you normally do in Pandoc](/docs/01-basics.qmd) and they will be linked üîó and backlinked üîó to the bibliography üìö

 ```markdown
 [@citekey]
 ```

 Use `[@Citekey]{.csl_field}` to arbitrarily print specific fields instead of the usual Author-Date üí™

  ```markdown
  [@citekey]{.author}
  [@citekey]{.title}
  [@citekey]{.original-title}
  ```
 Append the field name with a dot (`.`) to avoid creating a link to the bibliography in this particular citationüìç

  ```markdown
  [@citekey]{.author.}
  ```
 This can also be done globally by setting `link-fields: false` in the metadata^[If `link-citations` is `false` then `link-fields` will also default to `false`.] üåê

  ```yaml
  ---
  link-fields: false
  ---
  ```

 You're ready to rock. ü§ò

## Documentation üìö
This [Quarto-powered website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) documents the following filters:

- [{{< fa solid file-code >}}](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/citetools/blob/main/_extensions/citetools/multiple-bibliographies.lua) [multiple-bibliographies](/docs/02-multibib.qmd)
- [{{< fa solid file-code >}}](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/citetools/blob/main/_extensions/citetools/cite-field.lua) [cite-field](/docs/03-cite-field.qmd)
- [{{< fa solid file-code >}}](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/citetools/blob/main/_extensions/citetools/citation-backlinks.lua) [citation-backlinks](/docs/04-citation-backlinks.qmd)

In the future, we plan to add documentation for the following filters:

- [section-bibliographies](https://github.com/pandoc-ext/section-bibliographies)
- [recursive citeproc](https://github.com/dialoa/recursive-citeproc)
