# Introduction {.unnumbered}

The vanilla Pandoc and Quarto's Citeproc environment is powerful and its syntax is simple. It uses `[@Citekey]` for `Author (Date)` and `[-@Citekey]` for `(Date)`.^[In the case of `[-@Citekey]`, the `-` is being used switch on author suppresion. The page locator can always be appended using `[@Citekey, p. 1]` for `Author (Date, p. 1)` or `[-@Citekey, p. 1]` for `(Date, p. 1)`]


::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
The advantage of this markup syntax lies in its simplicity and the compatibility with all formats supported by Pandoc, a universal document converter.
:::

This extension introduces advanced bibliography features by bundling up several Lua filters ([see below](#license)). It allows, among other things, the creation of multiple bibliographies (or bibliographies with multiple sections, such as `primary sources` and `secondary sources`), the citation of arbitrary fields from the references, such as `author`, `editor`, or `translator` names and `title` / `original-title` of works, and last, but not least, the creation of linked indexes of citations.

1. Create multiple bibliographies (or bibliographies with multiple sections, such as `primary sources` and `secondary sources`).^[This is a feature that is common in other bibliography typesetting mechanisms, such as `BibLaTeX` and `BibTeX`, and that was sorely missing from Pandoc's Citeproc environment.]
2. Cite arbitrary fields from the references, such as `author`, `editor`, or `translator` names and `title` / `original-title` of works.^[This is also a feature that is common `BibLaTeX` and `BibTeX` through commands such as `\citeauthor`, `\citetitle`, `\citefield`, and so on.]
3. Turn the bibliography into a linked index of citations.

[[Multiple bibliographies]]


generate a bibliography in all formats supported by Pandoc (which totalize more than 30 formats, including `LaTeX`, `DOCX`, `HTML`, `EPUB`, `PDF`, and so on)

 but it lacks some features that are common in other bibliography typesetting mechanisms, such as `BibLaTeX` and `BibTeX`. This extension aims to fill these gaps using only *Lua Filters*.



## Features


More specifically, this bunddle seeks to address in the simplest of ways possible the following demands:

**1. Multiple bibliographies**

The need for multiple bibliographies (or bibliographies with multiple sections, such as `primary sources` and `secondary sources`).

![](img/2023-03-18-22-02-26.png)

**2. Cite fields**

The need to evoke arbitrary information from the references, such as `author`, `editor`, or `translator` names and `title` / `original-title` of works.

  <summary>`@AristOp` in `csljson`</summary>

```json
{
    "author": [
      {
        "family": "Aristotle"
      }
    ],
    "editor": [
      {
        "family": "Bekker",
        "given": "Immanuel"
      }
    ],
    "id": "AristOp",
    "issued": {
      "date-parts": [
        [
          1831
        ]
      ]
    },
    "number-of-volumes": "4",
    "publisher": "Reimer",
    "publisher-place": "Berlim",
    "title": "Aristotelis opera",
    "type": "book"
  }
```

</details>

**3. Citation backlinks**

The need to turn the bibliography into a linked index of cited references, with links from the entries back to each of its multiple occurences in the body of the text (*e.g.* in `PDF`/`DOCX`: `[p. 1, p. 4, p. 10]`, in `HTML`: `[1, 2, 3]`) (and with the ability to turn these off globally or in an *ad hoc* fashion).

![](img/2023-03-18-22-32-06.png)

- *Optionally*, the need to split the bibliography into sections, printing the bibliography for each chapter/section/part. (For this, you must uncomment the apropriate line in the `_extension.yaml` file.)

## Install

Users of Quarto can install this extension with the following command

```bash
quarto install extension bcdavasconcelos/citetools
```

and use it by adding `citetools` to the `filters` entry in their YAML header.

``` yaml
---
filters:
  - citetools
---
```

### Cite fields and citation backlinks global options

- `link-fields` (boolean): Link inlines printed by `citefield` to their corresponding entry in the bibliography. Default: `true`.
- `link-citations` (boolean): Link citations to their respective reference in the bibliography. Default: `true`. Note: if `link-citations` is set to `false`, `link-fields` is also set to `false`.
