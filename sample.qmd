# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This very concise sample ilustrates the use of `multiple-bibliographies` to separate primary (`refs/primary.json`) and secondary (`refs/secondary.json`) sources for the document; the use of `citation-backlinks` to turn  the bibliography into an index of citations with links back to the text; and the use of `citefield` to print in the body of the text useful information from the bibliographic references.

*Optionally*, `section-bibliographies` can be used to separate the bibliography into sections. For this, you must uncomment the apropriate line in the `_extension.yaml` file.



# The Works of Aristotle

This is an example of complex use of bibliographic references. We are relying on the bibliography to print in the text the correct names of the authors, editors, and translators & title of the works.

The works of [@AristOp]{.author.} were first edited by
[@AristOp]{.editor.} in [@AristOp]{.issued}. 

```markdown
The works of [@AristOp]{.author.} were first edited 
by [@AristOp]{.editor.} in [@AristOp]{.issued}. 
```

Later, the [@DA]{.title.} was edited by [@DABiehl1896]{.editor.} in [@DABiehl1896]{.issued} [repr. in [@DATheiler]{.translator.}'s [@DATheiler]{.issued} translation]; by [@DAForster]{.editor.} in [@DAForster]{.issued}; and by [@DARoss]{.editor.} in [@DARoss]{.issued}. 

```markdown
Later, the [@DA]{.title.} was edited by [@DABiehl1896]{.editor.}
in [@DABiehl1896]{.issued} [repr. in [@DATheiler]{.translator.}'s
[@DATheiler]{.issued} translation]; by [@DAForster]{.editor.} in
[@DAForster]{.issued}; and by [@DARoss]{.editor.} in [@DARoss]{.issued}.
```

The [@EN]{.title.} likewise was re-edited by [@ENBywater]{.editor.} in [@ENBywater]{.issued}; by [@ENBurnet]{.editor.} in [@ENBurnet]{.issued}; by [@ENSusemihlApelt1903]{.editor_first.} and [@ENSusemihlApelt1903]{.editor_second.} in [@ENSusemihlApelt1903]{.issued} [repr. in [@ENNatali]{.translator.}'s [@ENNatali]{.issued} translation].
