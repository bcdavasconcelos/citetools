Pandoc's Citeproc is a powerful and simple citation system. Here is a quick rundown of the syntax. The `@` symbol is used to indicate that the following text is a citation key (the unique identifier of the reference in the bibliography file).


> `@Aubenque1961a` says that...

> @Aubenque1961a says that...

Now the bracketted version that appears surrounded by parentheses.

> ...on the deliberations of the prudent person `[@Aubenque1961a]`.

> ...on the deliberations of the prudent person [@Aubenque1961a].


The citation key is *optionally* followed by a locator, which can be a page number, a line number, a chapter number, or a section number. The locator is preceded by a comma.

> ...on the deliberations of the prudent person `[@Aubenque1961a, p.15]`.

> ...on the deliberations of the prudent person [@Aubenque1961a, p.15].

The `-` symbol is *optionally* used to switch on author suppresion.

> ...on the deliberations of the prudent person `[-@Aubenque1961a]`.

> ...on the deliberations of the prudent person [-@Aubenque1961a].

And it can be used with locators.

> ...on the deliberations of the prudent person `[-@Aubenque1961a, p.15]`.

> ...on the deliberations of the prudent person [-@Aubenque1961a, p.15].
