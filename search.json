It is advisable to use a CSL file, as it will ensure that the bibliography is formatted according to the style of your choice. You can find a list of available CSL styles in the Citation Styles Github Repo and you can edit them with the CSL Visual Editor or using Zotero.\n\n\n\nIt is also advisable to keep the bibliography and CSL style files in the default Pandoc folder:\n\n macOS: ~/.local/share/pandoc\n Linux: ~/.local/share/pandoc\n Windows: C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\pandoc\n\nYou can find the path to your Pandoc folder by running the following command in your terminal:\npandoc --version\nThis way, you can use the same bibliography and CSL-style files in all your documents. Alternatively, you can keep the files in the same folder as your document, which is the approach favored by Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to share the Pandoc folder\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Pandoc folder needs to be shared among multiple devices, you can use a cloud service like Dropbox or Google Drive to store the files and use a symbolic link to place the files in the Pandoc folder. For example, if you are using Dropbox, you can run the following command in your terminal:\nln -s ~/Dropbox/Pandoc ~/.local/share/pandoc\nThe symbolic link will appear as a shortcut pointing to the Dropbox folder and any changes will be reflected in both locations.\n\n\n\nIf the files are in the default Pandoc folder or the same folder as the document, you can simply supply the file name:\nbibliography: bibfile.bib\ncsl: cslfile.csl\nYou can, but you don’t have to, place a div at the end of the document or where you want the bibliography to be printed.\n::: {.references}\n:::"

This is a standard schema for bibliographic data, which is used by some bibliography managers, such as Zotero, and JabRef. Most, however, are closer to the conventions of BibTeX (or RIS) which is why you may not see an exact correspondence between the CSL variables and BibTeX field names.\nIn CSL, there are the following variables:\n  abstract accessed annote archive archive_collection archive_location archive-place author authority available-date call-number chair chapter-number citation-key citation-label citation-number collection-editor collection-number collection-title compiler composer container-author container-title container-title-short contributor curator dimensions director division DOI edition editor editor-translator editorial-director event event-date event-place event-title executive-producer first-reference-note-number genre guest host illustrator interviewer ISBN ISSN issue issued jurisdiction keyword language license locator medium narrator note notes number number-of-pages number-of-volumes organizer original-author original-date original-publisher original-publisher-place original-title page page-first part-number part-title performer PMCID PMID printing-number producer publisher publisher-place recipient references reviewed-author reviewed-genre reviewed-title scale script-writer section series-creator source status submitted supplement-number title title-short translator URL version volume volume-title year-suffix\nHere is a quick reference, not exhaustive by any means, of where will the data end up in the conversion from BibTeX and RIS to CSL. This means that the CSL variables on the first column are the final destination and they receive the content of the second or third-column fields depending on the format it converts from.

Apart from being (a lot) faster, Citeproc will produce the same output across all formats supported by Pandoc, which amount to over 60, including HTML, LaTeX, and Word.\nOut-of-the-box, however, Citeproc does not provide common BibTeX functionalities, such as the ability to split the bibliography into multiple sections, or the ability to cite arbitrary fields of the references (e.g. citetitle, citeauthor, citefield). It also lacks the interesting backref option afforded by BibTeX and HyperRef, which allows for the creation of linked indexes of citations.\nLuckily, Citeproc is extensible, and this extension aims to provide a solution to these limitations and, hopefully, allow Pandoc and Quarto users to completely replace BibTeX/BibLaTeX with Citeproc. It will allow the user to easily create multiple bibliographies (or bibliographies with multiple sections, such as primary and secondary sources), cite arbitrary fields of the references1, and create linked indexes of citations2. All of this with very little configuration needed.\nAlso, with the advent of Quarto, it has become easier for those not well-versed Lua or Pandoc to use extensions such as this one! So, why not?!"

    "text": "Introduction\nThis very concise sample ilustrates the use of multiple-bibliographies to separate primary (refs/primary.json) and secondary (refs/secondary.json) sources for the document; the use of citation-backlinks to turn the bibliography into an index of citations with links back to the text; and the use of citefield to print in the body of the text useful information from the bibliographic references.\nOptionally, section-bibliographies can be used to separate the bibliography into sections. For this, you must uncomment the apropriate line in the _extension.yaml file.\n\n\nThe Works of Aristotle\nThis is an example of complex use of bibliographic references. We are relying on the bibliography to print in the text the correct names of the authors, editors, and translators & title of the works.\nThe works of [@AristOp]{.author} were first edited by\n[@AristOp]{.editor} in [@AristOp]{.issued}.\nThe works of Aristotle were first edited by Bekker in 1831.\nLater, the [@DA]{.title} was edited by [@DABiehl1896]{.editor}\nin [@DABiehl1896]{.issued} [repr. in [@DATheiler]{.translator}'s\n[@DATheiler]{.issued} translation]; by [@DAForster]{.editor} in\n[@DAForster]{.issued} [repr. in [@DACorcilius]{.translator}'s\n[@DACorcilius]{.issued} translation]; and by [@DARoss]{.editor}\nin [@DARoss]{.issued}.\nLater, the De anima was edited by Biehl in 1896 [repr. in Seidl’s 1995 translation]; by Förster in 1912 [repr. in Corcilius’s 2017 translation]; and by Ross in 1961.\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Sources\n\n\n\nAristotle. 1831a.
