    "text": "How to Setup Multiple Bibliographies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmultiple-bibliographies or multibib?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two versions of the multilple bibliographies filter by Albert Krewinkel. The first one is called multiple-bibliographies and it can be found in the Pandoc Lua Filters repository. The second one is called multibib and it can be found in its own repository. We are using the first one due to small issues with he second. The differences between them are boderline inexistent, but there are some. \nBoth filters are included in the bundle, but only multiple bibliographies is being used by default. You are, however, free to experiment with both editing the content of the _quarto.yaml file in the _extension folder. They have both been tweaked to work with the citetools extension.\n\n\n\nIf you are using Quarto, chances are you have a project folder. In this case, add bibliography files to the project folder (it is advisible adding them to a refs folder to prevent cluter in the root folder). Then, add the path to the files to the YAML metadata of your document in this way:\nbibliography_primary: refs/primary.json\nbibliography_secondary: refs/secondary.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmultibib\n\n\n\n\n\nWith multibib, you should add all of them to the bibliography entry instead, in the form of a dictionary.\nbibliography:  \n  primary: refs/primary.json  \n  secondary: refs/secondary.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYAML validation error cause by multibib\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using multibib, which requires a dictionary of key-value pairs in the bibliography field, Quarto will complain that the content of this field should be a string instead. To prevent an error, we should tell it to ignore the YAML validation:\nvalidate-yaml: false\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe path should be relative to the project’s root folder. The name of the bibliography should (but doesn’t have to) be the same as the name of the file, without the extension.\nThen, finally, place the bibliographies placeholders in the document where you want the bibliographies to appear.\n# Primary Sources\n\n::: {#refs_primary}\n:::\n\n# Secondary Sources\n\n::: {#refs_secondary}\n:::\nEach refs_bib_name div should have a matching entry bibliography_bib_name in the metadata. They will be filled with the citations from the respective bibliography files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiv names\n\n\n\n\n\nif you have a bibliography named bibliography_primary, the placeholder must be named refs-primary or refs_primary. That is, the name of the placeholder must match the name of the bibliography_ entry (without the prefix) otherwise nothing will print.\nAlso, please note that if the placeholder doesn’t make its way into the document, the references in that file will not be printed."

It is advisable to use a CSL file, as it will ensure that the bibliography is formatted according to the style of your choice. You can find a list of available CSL styles in the Citation Styles Github Repo and you can edit them with the CSL Visual Editor or using Zotero.\n\n\n\nIt is also advisable keeping the bibliography and CSL style files in the default Pandoc folder:\n\n macOS: ~/.local/share/pandoc\n Linux: ~/.local/share/pandoc\n Windows: C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\pandoc\n\nYou can find the path to your Pandoc folder by running the following command in your terminal:\npandoc --version\nThis way, you can use the same bibliography and CSL style files in all your documents. Alternatively, you can keep the files in the same folder as your document, which is the approach favored by Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to share the Pandoc folder\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Pandoc folder needs to me shared among multiple devices, you can use a cloud service like Dropbox or Google Drive to store the files and use a symbolic link to place the files in the Pandoc folder. For example, if you are using Dropbox, you can run the following command in your terminal:\nln -s ~/Dropbox/Pandoc ~/.local/share/pandoc\nThe symbolic link will appear as a shortcut pointing to the Dropbox folder and any changes will be reflected in both locations.\n\n\n\nIf the files are in Pandoc’s default folder or in the same folder as the document, you can simply supply the file name:\nbibliography: bibfile.bib\ncsl: cslfile.csl\nYou can, but you don’t have to, place a div at the end of the document or where you want the bibliography to be printed.\n::: {.references}\n:::"

This is a standard schema for bibliographic data, which is used by some bibliography managers, such as Zotero, and JabRef. Most, however, are closer to the conventions of BibTeX (or RIS) which is why you may not see an exact correspondence between the CSL variables and BibTeX field names.\nIn CSL, there are following variables:\n  abstract accessed annote archive archive_collection archive_location archive-place author authority available-date call-number chair chapter-number citation-key citation-label citation-number collection-editor collection-number collection-title compiler composer container-author container-title container-title-short contributor curator dimensions director division DOI edition editor editor-translator editorial-director event event-date event-place event-title executive-producer first-reference-note-number genre guest host illustrator interviewer ISBN ISSN issue issued jurisdiction keyword language license locator medium narrator note notes number number-of-pages number-of-volumes organizer original-author original-date original-publisher original-publisher-place original-title page page-first part-number part-title performer PMCID PMID printing-number producer publisher publisher-place recipient references reviewed-author reviewed-genre reviewed-title scale script-writer section series-creator source status submitted supplement-number title title-short translator URL version volume volume-title year-suffix\nHere is a quick reference, not exaustive by any means, of where will the data end up in the conversion from BibTeX and RIS to CSL.

    "text": "How to avoid an excess of undesired links\nIn citetools there are options to avoid undesired linking and anomalies caused by citing individual fields, such as repeated links to the same entry in a single phrase or section.\n\nTurning off links in individual citations\nFirst, there is the option to force a citation to not be a link by adding a simple dot at the end of the .csl_field.\n\n\n\nDefault\nLink-suppresion\n\n\n\n\n[@EN]{.title}\n[@EN]{.title.}\n\n\nEthica nicomachea\nEthica nicomachea\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal options\nThen, there is also the global link-fields option, which allows the user to turn off links in citations that target individual fields. It can be used in conjuntion with other options that target the bibliography, such as link-citations and link-bibliography.\n1link-citations: true\n2link-fields: true\n3link-bibliography: true\n4lang: en-US\n5notes-after-punctuation: true\n\n1\n\nIf true, citations will be hyperlinked to the corresponding bibliography entries (for author-date and numerical styles only). Defaults to false.\n\n2\n\nIf true, citations which target a specific variable or field will be hyperlinked to the corresponding bibliography entries (for author-date and numerical styles only). If link-citations is true, this defaults to true.\n\n3\n\nIf true, DOIs, PMCIDs, PMID, and URLs in bibliographies will be rendered as hyperlinks. (If an entry contains a DOI, PMCID, PMID, or URL, but none of these fields are rendered by the style, then the title, or in the absence of a title the whole entry, will be hyperlinked.) Defaults to true.\n\n4\n\nThe lang field will affect how the style is localized, for example in the translation of labels, the use of quotation marks, and the way items are sorted. (For backwards compatibility, locale may be used instead of lang, but this use is deprecated.)\n\n5\n\nIf true (the default for note styles), pandoc will put footnote references or superscripted numerical citations after following punctuation. For example, if the source contains blah blah [@jones99]., the result will look like blah blah.[^1], with the note moved after the period and the space collapsed. If false, the space will still be collapsed, but the footnote will not be moved after the punctuation. The option may also be used in numerical styles that use superscripts for citation numbers (but for these styles the default is not to move the citation)."

Eventually, when converting from one format to the other using Pandoc, the content of some fields may end up in perplexing places (or end up nowhere). This is a consequence of the fact that BibTeX and CSL are very different systems (one is very old, while the other still rather recent). So this page is meant as a quick reference for those bringing their references from the jurrasic BibTeX into the CSL-JSON/CSL-YAML using Pandoc and Quarto."

    "text": "Introduction\nThis very concise sample ilustrates the use of multiple-bibliographies to separate primary (refs/primary.json) and secondary (refs/secondary.json) sources for the document; the use of citation-backlinks to turn the bibliography into an index of citations with links back to the text; and the use of citefield to print in the body of the text useful information from the bibliographic references.\nOptionally, section-bibliographies can be used to separate the bibliography into sections. For this, you must uncomment the apropriate line in the _extension.yaml file.\n\n\nThe Works of Aristotle\nThis is an example of complex use of bibliographic references. We are relying on the bibliography to print in the text the correct names of the authors, editors, and translators & title of the works.\nThe works of [@AristOp]{.author} were first edited by\n[@AristOp]{.editor} in [@AristOp]{.issued}.\nThe works of Aristotle were first edited by Bekker in 1831.\nLater, the [@DA]{.title} was edited by [@DABiehl1896]{.editor}\nin [@DABiehl1896]{.issued} [repr. in [@DATheiler]{.translator}'s\n[@DATheiler]{.issued} translation]; by [@DAForster]{.editor} in\n[@DAForster]{.issued} [repr. in [@DACorcilius]{.translator}'s\n[@DACorcilius]{.issued} translation]; and by [@DARoss]{.editor}\nin [@DARoss]{.issued}.\nLater, the De anima was edited by Biehl in 1896 [repr. in Seidl’s 1995 translation]; by Förster in 1912 [repr. in Corcilius’s 2017 translation]; and by Ross in 1961.\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Sources\n\n\n\nAristotle. 1831a.
